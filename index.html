      "Some people called him Jebediah. Others Jeremiah. Most didn't care as long as he didn't stare at them. Or talk to them.",
      "He would have a new mail-order bride every other cattle season and teach their kids the wrong way to wrassle while the other cow folk watched with interest as well as shock. Mostly they just cringed.",
      "He would \"take notes\" and \"share his insight\" to the other folks, who generally didn't understand if he knew the point of cattle roping.",
      "He is truly the inspiration for cattydicking. A term coined in 1839 in the old west specifically for Jebediah... Jeremiah... whatever Jimbo."
